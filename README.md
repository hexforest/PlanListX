# ðŸ“š PlanListX

PlanListX is an open-source, cross-platform notes and planning application built with Electron and React. It allows you to quickly capture notesâ€”single words, sentences, or entire thoughtsâ€”and organize them into groups you can navigate through an intuitive dashboard. Each group can also be displayed as a floating popup note, helping you focus on what matters.

PlanListX is designed for writers, thinkers, students, developers, and anyone who needs a fast, distraction-free tool for capturing and organizing ideas.
